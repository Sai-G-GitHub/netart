    <p>There once was a man from Peru,</p>
    <p>Who dreamed he was eating his shoe.</p>
    <p>He awoke with a fright,</p>
    <p>In the middle of the night,</p>
    <p>And found that his dream had come true.</p>

    <p class="title">Limerick 2</p>
    <p>There once was a cat with a hat,</p>
    <p>Who thought he was quite the diplomat.</p>
    <p>But his hat flew away,</p>
    <p>On a very fine day,</p>
    <p>And he ended up flat on his mat.</p>
